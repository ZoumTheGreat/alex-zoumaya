# Welcome To My Repository 
In this repository reside a few of my projects, whether they had been school projects or personal. 

# Interpy 
Interpy is an interpreter written in Python. The purpose of this project was to develop our own programming language with its own syntax. We tried to make ours as simple as possible and using the PLY Library (Python Lex and Yacc), it was really easy to construct a language of our choosing. 

# Snap Copy Paste
Snap Copy Paste was done apart of my capstone class at the University of Dayton with help from Synchrony Financial. SCP was built using the Angular TypeScript framework. Although we are very proud of the progress we had made on SCP, Covid really hampered our efforts to make the site completely bug free. As a result, phone cameras do not work on the site yet, but try it out with a screenshot of text!
