# Welcome To My Repository 
In this repository reside a few of my projects, whether they had been school projects or personal. 

# Interpy 
Interpy is an interpreter written in Python. The purpose of this project was to develop our own programming language with its own syntax. We tried to make ours as simple as possible and using the PLY Library (Python Lex and Yacc), it was really easy to construct a language of our choosing. 

# Snap Copy Paste
Snap Copy Paste was done apart of my capstone class at the University of Dayton with help from Synchrony Financial. SCP was built using the Angular TypeScript framework. Although we are very proud of the progress we had made on SCP, Covid really hampered our efforts to make the site completely bug free. As a result, phone cameras do not work on the site yet, but try it out with a screenshot of text!

# BSC Project
Throughout high school, I depended on a small business called the Bradley Sports Center for work. Last year I contacted them for work over winter break, just needing extra cash, I was ready to sweep floors all day. The owner reached out to me about an invoice issue the company was facing and thought my experience with computer science could help. I researched the programs they were using and used Python to develop a simple way to automatically move invoices. What used to take weeks to finish, was completed in a couple of days thanks to the web runner file. Unfortunately, they did not want to pay for a developer accout, so I could not use the normal API, so I had to find a Python library to help me out.

# Tweepy

This was done as apart of a Networking class at the University of Dayton. The goal was to use the Tweepy to crawl various twitter accounts and use the full strength of the API. The project can; find information on users, look for tweets with a specific keyword(s), find tweets based on latitude and longitude, and even do a Depth-First-Search on a Users twitter accounts. The DFS function is capped because of the limitations in API calls per hour.
