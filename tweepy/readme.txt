Alex Zoumaya - Carl Schultz Assignment 2 part 2

To run this assignment:
$ echo "" > bfs_printer.txt
$ python main.py username.txt

The output of this assignment will all be printed in bfs_printer.txt. The output is Username of person we are searching
through then the 2 friends extracted from the account. Due to Tweepy's 15 request timeout, after 15 requests a 15 minute
sleep is placed within the code. The program itself takes approx 35 minutes to run. If you have any questions about the
program, please reach out via email.

Dr. Yao changed the requirements for this assignment several times, so parts b and c are confusing

D) This was a fun and interesting assignment, but the timeout limitations of Tweepy make the assignments slightly
difficult especially in terms of testing code.
